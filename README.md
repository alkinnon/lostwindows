Recover program windows .. on Windows

When changing between multiple monitors, I found some application positions would be lost off-screen.
This simple little program will scan for offscreen windows, and pull them back to the main display desktop without having to fiddle with taskbar icons, shift and cursor keys.

Open source and free to use for non-commercial use.

# Usage
Simply download the program file, put it somewhere sensible and run it.
The app includes a refresh button should you want to repeat the recovery process.
